# Software development 20 years Ago
  - clarifying documentation (100 pages) to clearly define what they want

# Agile as an approach
  - framework, attitude, approach
    - lean, fast and pragmatic

# Every week, want some working plans
  - break things down into smaller pieces
  - focus on what's important
    - easy to prioritize changes
  - lots of testing
    - it needs to be production ready every week
  - allows for feedback
    - Homi, am I on track?
  - plans are adaptive
  - accountable because of timeline

skipping to user stories, the important part

# User stories

  - key aspects of user stories
    - lean and accurate
    - simple planning
    - fast/easy to create
    - based on feedback/what we've learned
    - collaboration + discussion
    
  - **Option 1** Should be as few words as possible
    - ex) Add a Sign in Page
      - this is short and sweet

  - **Option 2** Templated
    - As a [type of user], I want [some goal], so that [derived benefit]
      - As an Administrator, I want a sign in page so that I can have access to superuser features
        - answers who, what, why
        - might get a little long
  - **Option 3** Hybrid
    - Use option 1 for planning
    - Use option 2 for implementation
  
- From the asignment, we should get as many features (user stories) as possible\
  - then, rank them in time it will take to complete
    - 1 point, one day to get working
    - 3 points, few days to get working
    - 5 points, all week to get workin
      - 10 days (optional), Will be really hard to get working
      - may be smart to split this up into smaller sub tasks
 
# How we should do this as a team (kind of already did this last week)
  
  - someone plays the role of a customer
    - reads off features needed from the assignment
  
  - individually, everyone assigns it a value (how long it will take to get done)
    - then compare
    - come to an agreement
