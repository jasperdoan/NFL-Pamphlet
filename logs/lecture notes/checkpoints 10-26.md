# How we could have designed the User Stories
- ignore part about 10 user stories

- Some of the requirements are user stories

- Examples:
	- Help Option
		- how deep is this feature? we don't know!
			- but, we will have a conversation about it later
			- (whole point of user story)
	- Contact Us option
- can combine Help and Contact us into one user story
	- changing stuff is key to agile team
- Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are about displaying the original list
	- Display list of teams
		- put everything in terms of display list of teams...?

# 3 Main stories
- main menu
- display league stats
- display list of teams

# all three need to be broken down
- main menu
	- as a user, I want to access a main menu so that I have centralized access to all the actions I can take
		- gives context
		- starting with the end goal in mind
		- how do we know when this user story is done?
			- 99% isn't done, it has to be ALL THE WAY done
			- so we need to be clear on what "done" means
	- This will be done when user clicks help button and user recieves help prompt, same with contact us
	--- 
	- **Tasks**
		- this is where it gets really broken down
- display league stats
- display list of teams
