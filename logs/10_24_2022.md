    + Main UI - @wluxie || @max9001
    + Email UI - @wluxie || @max9001
    + Admin UI - @Alee232

- BRANCHING:
![](./img/10_24_git_branching.jpg)
- Discussed splitting up the different UI windows.
- When creating different UI pages (help, email, login, etc), they are their own separate branches that will be implemented all together into main. 
    + This will allow for each UI to be developed separately and then merged into main.
    + For instance, help UI will be developed on `design/helpWindow` branch. Once the UI is complete, it will be merged into `main` branch.
